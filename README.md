After installing oh-my-zsh, how to solve the error when executing 
the previously used command

Problem : "zsh: command not found:flutter"

Cause : Installing oh-my-zsh will enable the Zsh shell by default. 
        There may be some differences from the Bash shell you're used to, and you may run into problems, 
        especially with your PATH variable settings.
